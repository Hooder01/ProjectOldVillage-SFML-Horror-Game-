Project Old Town

Is a planned retro horror game with an NES style 

You play as a male protag going through the "old town" and it's undead secrets 

I want to build this ethier in SDL or Open GL after the feb build of Sonic between worlds in complete 

This is simply a hobby project people in the future can play (most likey for free) 

Project fils and Assets will both remain in this folder but I need to back up at somepoint.

Github will also be used
